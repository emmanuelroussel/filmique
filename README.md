# filmique

Front end for filmique, a web app that helps you find movies to watch.

## Description
Simple web app I built to learn [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

Communicates with [filmique API](https://github.com/emmanuelroussel/filmique-api), a wrapper I built around [TMDb API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) and [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/). All the data comes from these two APIs.

Note: This was simply built to learn Koa 2 and Vue.js. I do not have control over the data returned by TMDb. Their API often returns very underground and weird movies.

## Getting Started

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
